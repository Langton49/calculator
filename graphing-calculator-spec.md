# Pyth Web Application - Specification

## Project Overview
An all-in-one web-based graphing calculator that serves as both a standard calculator and an advanced visualization tool for students studying calculus and statistics.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Basic Calculator
- [ ] Standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^)
- [ ] Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, etc.)
- [ ] Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- [ ] History of calculations
- [ ] Keyboard and mouse input support

### 2. 2D Graphing
- [ ] Plot functions like f(x) = x^2, sin(x), etc.
- [ ] Multiple functions on same graph
- [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities
- [ ] Grid and axis customization
- [ ] Function table generation
- [ ] Intersection points and roots finding

### 3. 3D Graphing (Calculus 3)
- [ ] Plot 3D surfaces z = f(x,y)
- [ ] Parametric curves and surfaces
- [ ] Vector fields
- [ ] Interactive rotation and zoom
- [ ] Cross-sections and level curves
- [ ] Partial derivatives visualization

### 4. Statistical Plotting
- [ ] Scatter plots
- [ ] Histograms
- [ ] Box plots
- [ ] Regression analysis (linear, polynomial)
- [ ] Data import (CSV, manual entry)
- [ ] Statistical calculations (mean, median, std dev)

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Framework
- React/Vue/Vanilla JS?
- State management needs
- Component architecture

### Mathematical Engine
- Expression parsing library
- Numerical computation accuracy
- Performance for complex calculations

### Visualization Libraries
- 2D: Canvas API, D3.js, Chart.js?
- 3D: Three.js, WebGL?
- Performance considerations for real-time rendering

### User Experience
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet support)
- Accessibility features
- Intuitive interface design

## Questions to Resolve
1. Target audience level (high school vs college)?
2. Offline capability requirements?
3. Sharing/export features needed?
4. Performance requirements (how complex should 3D rendering be)?

## Development Phases
TBD - to be defined based on requirements refinement
