# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A comprehensive web-based graphing calculator designed for college-level mathematics students. The application will serve as both a standard scientific calculator and an advanced visualization tool capable of plotting 2D functions, 3D surfaces, and statistical data. The tool aims to help students visualize mathematical concepts in calculus, statistics, and other advanced mathematics courses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a college mathematics student, I want a fully functional scientific calculator, so that I can perform complex mathematical operations without switching between tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the correct result
2. WHEN a user enters scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, factorial) THEN the system SHALL compute the accurate mathematical result
3. WHEN a user uses parentheses in expressions THEN the system SHALL respect order of operations
4. WHEN a user enters an invalid expression THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
5. WHEN a user accesses calculation history THEN the system SHALL display previous calculations in chronological order
6. WHEN a user uses memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve values correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a calculus student, I want to plot 2D mathematical functions, so that I can visualize function behavior and analyze mathematical relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a function like f(x) = x^2 THEN the system SHALL render an accurate 2D graph
2. WHEN a user plots multiple functions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL display them with different colors on the same coordinate plane
3. WHEN a user interacts with the graph THEN the system SHALL support zoom in/out and pan functionality
4. WHEN a user hovers over the graph THEN the system SHALL display coordinate values at the cursor position
5. WHEN a user requests function analysis THEN the system SHALL identify and mark critical points, roots, and intersections
6. WHEN a user customizes the graph THEN the system SHALL allow modification of axis ranges, grid visibility, and colors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a multivariable calculus student, I want to visualize 3D mathematical surfaces, so that I can understand complex spatial relationships and surface behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a function z = f(x,y) THEN the system SHALL render an accurate 3D surface plot
2. WHEN a user interacts with the 3D plot THEN the system SHALL support rotation, zoom, and pan with mouse controls
3. WHEN a user views the 3D surface THEN the system SHALL provide proper lighting and shading for depth perception
4. WHEN a user customizes the 3D view THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of viewing angle, surface color, and transparency
5. WHEN a user requests surface analysis THEN the system SHALL display coordinate values and function values at cursor position
6. WHEN the system renders complex surfaces THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance without significant lag

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a statistics student, I want to create various statistical plots and perform data analysis, so that I can visualize data patterns and compute statistical measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports data or enters data manually THEN the system SHALL accept and store the dataset correctly
2. WHEN a user requests a scatter plot THEN the system SHALL display data points with appropriate scaling and labeling
3. WHEN a user creates a histogram THEN the system SHALL automatically determine appropriate bin sizes or allow manual specification
4. WHEN a user performs regression analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the best-fit line with correlation coefficient
5. WHEN a user requests statistical calculations THEN the system SHALL compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance
6. WHEN a user exports statistical results THEN the system SHALL provide data in a readable format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student using various devices, I want the calculator to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and input methods, so that I can access it anywhere I study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch input
2. WHEN a user uses keyboard input THEN the system SHALL support standard mathematical notation and keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN a user switches between calculator modes THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent and intuitive interface
4. WHEN a user works offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function for basic calculations and previously loaded functions
5. WHEN a user needs accessibility features THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation
6. WHEN the system loads THEN the system SHALL be ready for use within 3 seconds on standard internet connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mathematics student, I want to save and share my work, so that I can reference previous calculations and collaborate with classmates or instructors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates graphs or calculations THEN the system SHALL provide options to save work locally
2. WHEN a user wants to share results THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links or export images
3. WHEN a user returns to saved work THEN the system SHALL restore the exact state of calculations and graphs
4. WHEN a user exports graphs THEN the system SHALL provide high-quality image formats suitable for academic use
5. WHEN a user manages saved work THEN the system SHALL provide organization tools like naming and categorizing
6. WHEN a user accesses shared content THEN the system SHALL load and display it accurately without requiring the original creator's presence
